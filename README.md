### Project Structure

`src/components` - React components that can be used anywhere in the application. They are independent of their usage.

`src/features` - React components that have specific purpose. They are depened on their usage. This is what makes up our application.

`src/hooks` - Custom React hooks used across many features.

`src/models` - TypeScript interfaces to make our lives easier.

`src/styles` - `mui` (Material-UI) and `styled-components` related global styles.

`src/utils` - Some utility functions.

### Things that could have been done better with more time

-   Responsiveness. Please try to use a screen of at least 1366px in width.

-   More code comments documentation. I have done my best to write comments where it's not abvious what the code does.

-   More modular. I have done by best to make the components modular and small as possible.

### Extra notes

-   This is my first time using a component library - [MUI](https://mui.com/)
